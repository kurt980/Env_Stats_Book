# **Chapter 1: Introduction to R**

## Section 1. Getting Started With R

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. Among other things it has

-   an effective data handling and storage facility,

-   a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,

-   a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,

-   graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at the computer or on hard copy, and a well developed, simple and effective programming language (called ‘S’) which includes conditionals,

-   loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output facilities. (Indeed most of the system supplied functions are themselves written in the S language.)

The term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software. R is very much a vehicle for newly developing methods of interactive data analysis. It has developed rapidly, and has been extended by a large collection of packages. However, most programs written in R are essentially ephemeral, written for a single piece of data analysis.

### Environment Setup

Before you start, you want to do these 3 things first:

-   **Install R** R is a programming language

-   **Install RStudio** RStudio is the most widely-used IDE for R

-   **Install tidyverse** tidyverse is the collection of packages that are widely used for data analysis. The detailed introduction to tidyverse can be found in Section 1.2. You can use the below command in R to install tidyverse

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    # install.packages("tidyverse")
    library(tidyverse)
    library(dplyr)
    library(magrittr)
    ```

-   **The pipe operator**

    The %\>% operator, also known as the "pipe operator", is a powerful feature introduced by the `magrittr` package in R. It allows for a more readable and concise way of chaining together multiple function calls or operations. The pipe operator facilitates the creation of efficient and streamlined data analysis pipelines.

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    # Using pipe operator to integrate commands
    example <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), y = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10))

    # Calculate the mean of y for rows where x is greater than 2
    mean_y <- example %>% subset(x > 2) %>% pull(y) %>% mean()

    # Print the mean
    print(mean_y)
    ```

### Introduction to Packages

In R, "packages" are collections of functions, data, and documentation designed to extend the functionality of the base R system. These packages serve as valuable tools that provide specialized capabilities, making complex tasks easier to accomplish and expanding the scope of data analysis and statistical modeling. Each package is designed to address specific data analysis needs, making it easier for users to perform tasks from different disciplines.

Using packages in R is a seamless process. Once a package is installed, you can load it into your R session using the `library()` function. This makes all the functions and data sets within the package available for use. The packages and collections covered in this book are listed below. Most of them are integrated into the `tidyverse` collection.

-   **MASS** The "MASS" package includes various functions for statistical modeling, linear and nonlinear regression, generalized linear models, time series analysis, clustering, and more. Additionally, it offers data sets used in the book's examples and exercises, allowing users to replicate and experiment with the presented statistical methods.

-   **Tidyverse** The `tidyverse` package is a collection of R packages that provides a consistent and coherent framework for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization, promoting a tidy data format and streamlined data analysis workflows. The core packages within the `tidyverse`, including `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `lubridate`, `magrittr` and `purrr`, among others, offer powerful tools for data import, transformation, visualization, and modeling.

-   **magrittr** The `magrittr` package provides a set of operators, most notably the pipe operator `%>%`, that enhances code readability and promotes a more fluent programming style in R. By chaining functions together, `magrittr` allows users to create a more structured and expressive data manipulation workflow.

-   **ggplot2** `ggplot2` is a versatile and comprehensive data visualization package based on the Grammar of Graphics. With `ggplot2`, users can effortlessly create sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing visualizations that effectively communicate insights from their data.

-   **dplyr** `dplyr` is a powerful package designed for data manipulation tasks in R. With a concise syntax and intuitive functions like `filter()`, `arrange()`, `mutate()`, and `summarise()`, `dplyr` simplifies and streamlines data wrangling, making it an essential tool for data analysts and data scientists.

-   **lubridate** `lubridate` is a package specifically tailored for working with dates and times in R. Its user-friendly functions enable users to parse, manipulate, and format date-time data, making time-related analysis and data manipulation tasks more efficient and accurate.

-   **readr** `readr` is a fast and efficient package for reading and importing data into R. By providing easy-to-use functions to read various file formats, readr simplifies the data reading process and ensures accurate representation of data, enabling smoother data analysis workflows.

### Variables

You can create variables like in all other programming languages using "-\textgreater{" or "="

```{r}
x <- 21 
print(x)

x <- "text" 
print(x)
```

### Numbers and Vectors

You can also assign numeric values or vectors to your variables

-   **Numbers can be in many forms**

    ```{r}
    # Create numbers in r 
    x <- 3.5 # numeric 
    y <- 3L # integer 
    z <- 1i # complex
    ```

-   **Vectors**

    ```{r}
    # Using the combine operator `c()` in r 
    u <- c(1,1,2,3,5) 
    # Using the sequence operator `:` in r 
    v <- 1:5

    print(u) 
    print(v)

    # length of vectors 
    length(u)
    ```

### Strings and Boolean

Other types of variables include strings and booleans

-   **String**

    ```{r}
    # String 
    s <- "This is a string" 
    print(s)
    ```

-   **Boolean**

    ```{r}
    # Boolean 
    a <- TRUE 
    b <- (1 > 2)

    print(a) 
    print(b)
    ```

### Working with Dates

Working with dates is supported by R. Date is a specific type of object implemented in R and supplemented by other packages such as lubridate

-   **Date formatting**

```{r}
# Date formatting 
date <- as.Date("2023-07-10") 
formatted_date <- format(date, "%A, %B %d, %Y") 
print(formatted_date)
# test
```

-   **Date manipulation**

```{r}
require(lubridate)

# Adding days to a date 
date <- as.Date("2023-07-10") 
new_date <- date + 7 
print(new_date)

# Subtracting months from a date 
date <- as.Date("2023-07-10") 
new_date <- date - months(3) 
print(new_date)

# Calculating the difference between two dates 
date1 <- as.Date("2023-07-10") 
date2 <- as.Date("2023-06-10") 
diff <- date1 - date2 
print(diff)
```

## Section 2. Fundamentals

To perform meaningful tasks, you need to use operators, functions and loops smartly

### Math and Logical Operators

-   Fundamental operators

    ```{r}
    # plus, minus, multiply and subtraction
    x <- 1
    y <- 2

    # print multiple arguments together using `cat`
    cat(x+y, x-y, x*y, x/y)
    ```

-   Logarithm and exponential

    ```{r}
    # print exp(2) and log(1)
    cat(exp(y), log(x))
    ```

-   Operations on vectors

    ```{r}
    # compute the vector max,min and median
    u <- c(-1, 0, 3, -12.5, 8.3)
    cat(max(u), min(u), median(u))
    # compute the sum and length
    cat(sum(u), length(u))
    ```

-   Logical operators

    ```{r}
    # and or
    x <- TRUE
    y <- FALSE

    cat(x && y, x || y)
    ```

### Functions

Functions in R are blocks of organized code designed to perform specific tasks, allowing you to efficiently reuse and modularize your code.

```{r}
# Write a function that calculates the correlation between 2 vectors of the same length
my_function <- function(v1, v2) {
    # add a guard clause for the input
    if (length(v1) != length(v2)) {
        stop("input vectors have different lengths")
    }

    mean1 <- mean(v1)
    mean2 <- mean(v2)
    
    numerator <- sum((v1 - mean1) * (v2 - mean2))
    denominator <- sqrt(sum((v1 - mean1)^2) * sum((v2 - mean2)^2))
    
    correlation <- numerator / denominator
    return(correlation)
}

my_function(c(1,3,5,7), c(2,4,6,8)) # call the function named my_function
```

### If/Else Statements

```{r}
# Example: Determine if a number is even or odd
num <- 7

# use the mod operator `%%`
if (num %% 2 == 0) {
  result <- "Even"
} else {
  result <- "Odd"
}

# print text and variables together using `cat`
cat("The number", num, "is", result)
```

### Loops

Loops in R, such as for and while, enable iterative execution of code for efficient repetitive tasks.

```{r}
# Use a for loop to print the first 10 elements of the Fibonacci sequence
for (i in 1:10) {
    if (i == 1 || i == 2) {
        prevprev = 1
        prev = 1
        cat(1, " ")
    } else {
        curr = prevprev + prev
        cat(curr, " ")
        prevprev = prev
        prev = curr
    }
}
```

```{r}
# Use a while loop to find all the divisors of 336
n = 336
divisor = 2

while (divisor <= sqrt(n)) {
    if (n %% divisor == 0) {
      cat(divisor, ' ')  # Found a divisor, print it out
    }
    divisor <- divisor + 1
    }
```

## Section 3. Data Fundamentals

### Lists

We can store data in a list:

```{r}
# List of strings
thislist <- list("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# Print the list
print(thislist)
```

```{r}
# access a list element
print(thislist[1])
# access multiple elements
print(thislist[1:2])
```

### Matrices and Arrays

-   Matrix

    Matrix is 2-D

    ```{r}
    # Create a matrix
    mat <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)

    # Print the matrix
    mat
    ```

-   Array

    Array can be more than 2-D

    ```{r}
    # create a 3-dimensional array
    arr <- array(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), dim = c(2,2,2))

    # Print the array
    arr
    ```

### Manipulating Matrices and Arrays

You can access, edit, do operations and even combine matrices and arrays using the parsing technique

-   Access elements

    ```{r}
    # Print the 2nd row of a matrix
    mat[2,]

    # Use multi-level parsing
    arr[1,2,1]
    ```

-   Edit elements

    ```{r}
    # Change the second element of the first row
    mat[1,2] = 96
    # Change the second column of the first matrix
    arr[,2,1] = c(97,98)

    # Print the matrix
    print(mat)
    print(arr)
    ```

-   Perform element-wise operations

    ```{r}
    # Creating 2 matrices
    mat1 <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2)
    mat2 <- matrix(5:8, nrow = 2)

    # Addition of two matrices
    print(mat1 + mat2)
    # Element-wise multiplication of two matrices
    print(mat1 * mat2)
    ```

-   Combine matrices You can bind matrices use `rbind` and `cbind`

    ```{r}
    # Stack a matrix on the top of the other
    print(rbind(mat1,mat2))
    # Link matrices side by side
    print(cbind(mat1,mat2))
    ```

### Dataframes

Dataframe is a powerful object that allows you to perform all kinds of operations on your data

```{r}
# create a dataframe
Data_Frame <- data.frame (
  Training = c("Strength", "Stamina", "Other"),
  Pulse = c(100, 150, 120),
  Duration = c(60, 30, 45)
)

# Print the data frame
Data_Frame
# access dataframe elements using the dollar sign
print(Data_Frame$Pulse)
```

## Section 4. Read/Load/Output Data

Read data from local files, load data from online source, write data into local files.

### Read Data

```{r}
# Load text file
data <- read.csv("data/CMI_TRH.csv")

head(data, 5)
```

### Write Data

```{r}
# write.csv(data, file = "filename.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```

### Readr

The `read` package is designed to read rectangular data (like 'csv', 'tsv', and 'fwf'). You can use the `readr` package to perform more advanced file operations in r

```{r}
# install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
```

-   `read_csv()`: comma-separated values (CSV)
-   `read_tsv()`: tab-separated values (TSV)
-   `read_csv2()`: semicolon-separated values with , as the decimal mark
-   `read_delim()`: delimited files (CSV and TSV are important special cases)
-   `read_fwf()`: fixed-width files
-   `read_table()`: whitespace-separated files
-   `read_log()`: web log files

**Operations of Readr**

-   You can specify column types with a series of codes, note we are using `read_csv` from the `readr` package, not the built-in `read.csv`

    ```{r}
    # Read with custom column types
    data <- read_csv("data/CMI_TRH.csv", 
                      col_types = cols(
                                      year = col_integer(),
                                      month = col_integer(),
                                      day = col_integer(),
                                      avg_rel_hum = col_double(),
                                      avg_air_temp_f = col_double(),
                                      avg_air_temp_c = col_double(),
                                      date_string = col_character(),
                                      date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y") # be sure this format matches the one in your data
                                      )
                     )
    ```

Now the "date" column in your dataset has the date type

## Section 5. Working with Dataframes

Dataframe is powerful with geostatistical data analysis.

### Manipulate Data

-   Parsing data

    You can parse data by location to get different portions of the data.

    ```{r}
    # Print first 3 rows
    data[1:3,]
    ```

    ```{r}
    # Print first 3 rows and 3 columns
    data[1:3,1:3]
    ```

-   Add a new column

```{r}
    # Remember this dataset we used?
    head(Data_Frame)
```

```{r}
    # Add a new column
    New_df <- cbind(Data_Frame, NewCol = c('new1','new2','new3'))

    # A new column is added to the end
    New_df
```

-   Remove a column

    ```{r}
    # Remove a column using the dollar sign
    New_df$NewCol <- NULL

    # The new column is gone
    New_df
    ```

### Apply functions

The apply function family in R provides powerful tools for efficiently working with arrays, lists, and data frames by applying custom functions across dimensions, simplifying complex operations and data transformations.

-   apply

    Applies a function to rows or columns of an array-like object.

    ```{r}
    # apply the mean and sd function to a dataframe to get the mean and standard deviation of columns
    df <- matrix(rnorm(25), ncol = 5) # 100 random variables organzied into 5 columns
    print(df)
    apply(df, 2, function(x) c(mean=mean(x), sd=sd(x)))
    ```

-   lapply

    Applies a function to each element of a list, maintaining a list structure.

    ```{r}
    # use lapply to find the column sums of the 2 dataframes
    list_of_dfs <- list(data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 4:6), data.frame(x = 7:9, y = 10:12))
    print(list_of_dfs)
    lapply(list_of_dfs, function(df) colSums(df))
    ```

-   sapply

    Applies a function to each element of a list, aiming to streamline output.

    ```{r}
    # use sapply to find the cumulative sum along columns
    df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = c(4, 5, 6), c = c(7, 8, 9))
    sapply(df, cumsum)
    ```

-   mapply

    Applies a function to corresponding elements from multiple vectors or lists.

    ```{r}
    # Use mapply to find if each "divisor" divides its corresponding "integer"
    integers <- c(14, 196, 1321, 948, 125)
    divisors <- c(2, 4, 7, 12, 3)
    mapply(function(s, r) s %% r == 0, integers, divisors)
    ```

### Dplyr

`dplyr` is a powerful package within the `tidyverse` that provides a set of intuitive and efficient functions for data manipulation, transformation, and summarization in R.

```{r}
# Load dplyr library
library(dplyr)
```

#### Study Data

-   **Descriptive Statistics**

    You can get descriptive statistics for a dataframe using dplyr and the 'pipe' operator easily.

    ```{r}
    # Calculate descriptive statistics using dplyr
    summary_df <- data %>%
      summarise(
        Mean_Hum = mean(avg_rel_hum),
        Median_Hum = median(avg_rel_hum),
        SD_Hum = sd(avg_rel_hum),
        Min_Hum = min(avg_rel_hum),
        Max_Hum = max(avg_rel_hum),
        Count = n()
      )

    print(summary_df)
    ```

-   **Select and Filter data**

    ```{r}
    # Select average humidity and date
    selected_data <- data %>%
      select(avg_rel_hum, date_string)

    print(selected_data[1:5,])

    # Filter rows based on the value of average humidity
    filtered_data <- data %>%
      filter(avg_rel_hum > 100)

    print(filtered_data)
    ```

-   **Sort data**

    ```{r}
    # Sorting the data frame by "year" column in ascending order
    data_sorted <- data %>%
      arrange(avg_rel_hum)

    print(data_sorted[1:5, ])
    ```

-   **Group by data**

    You can also find the aggregate values by grouping data.

    ```{r}
    # Find the mean average humidity of each year
    grouped_data <- data %>%
      group_by(year) %>%
      summarise(Avg_Hum = mean(avg_rel_hum))

    print(grouped_data[1:5, ])
    ```

## Section 6. Plots and Graphics

### Basic Plots

The built-in `plot` function in R allows you to create scatter plots, line charts and other common graphics for statistical analysis.

-   **scatter plot**

    ```{r}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(dplyr)
    library(magrittr)

    # Select average humidity and date
    data_between_2010_2012 <- data %>%
        filter(year >= 2010 & year <= 2012)

    # Create a scatter plot
    plot(data_between_2010_2012$avg_rel_hum, data_between_2010_2012$avg_air_temp_c, main = "AVG Rel Humidity VS. AVG Rel Temperature in C, between 2010-2012", xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", pch = 16, col = "blue")
    ```

-   **histogram and bar plot**

    ```{r}
    # Create a histogram 
    hist(data_between_2010_2012$avg_rel_hum, main = "AVG Rel Humidity between 2010 and 2012", xlab = "Value", ylab = "Frequency", col = "lightblue")
    ```

-   **box plot**

    ```{r}
    # Create a box plot for average realative humidity each year
    boxplot(avg_rel_hum ~ year, data = data_between_2010_2012,
            main = "Distribution of AVG Rel Humidity by Year",
            xlab = "Year", ylab = "AVG Rel Humidity",
            col = "lightblue", border = "black")
    ```

-   **multiple plots and organize plots**

    You can use par() to organize the positions of multiple plots

    ```{r}
    data_cmi <- read.csv("data/CMI_TRH.csv")
        
        # Set up a 3x4 grid for 12 plots
        par(mfrow = c(3, 4), mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1))
        
        # Loop through each month
        for (m in unique(data_cmi$month)) {
          # Subset data for the current month
          month_data <- subset(data_cmi, month == m)
        
          # Create a histogram
          hist(month_data$avg_air_temp_c, main = paste("Histogram for Month=", m), breaks=20,
               xlab = "Average Air Temperature [C]", col = "lightgreen", probability = TRUE)
        
          # Add a bell curve
          curve(dnorm(x, mean = mean(month_data$avg_air_temp_c), sd = sd(month_data$avg_air_temp_c)),
                add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 2)
        }
        
        # Reset par settings
        par(mfrow = c(1, 1), mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)
    ```

### ggplot2

`ggplot2` is another package that allows you to create elegant and customized plots with a concise and intuitive syntax. The `ggplot2` package uses a streamlined style of grammar with multiple "layers", allowing you to compose your own plot in a more elegant and intuitive way.

```{r}
# install.packages('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)
```

-   **Adding other dimensions for the plot**

    You can also add color and size to represent more dimensions.

    ```{r}
    # Create the bubble chart
    ggplot(data[1:100, ], 
           aes(x = avg_rel_hum, y = avg_air_temp_f, size = avg_air_temp_c, color = month)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(x = "avg_rel_hum", y = "avg_air_temp_f", title = "Bubble Chart")
    ```

-   **Create insightful visualizations**

    We will do an example to find the highest and lowest average air temperature in the year 2012, and plot them using `ggplot2`, along with the average relative humidity

    ```{r}
    # Find the highest temperature in 2012
    data %>%
      filter(year(date) == 2012) %>%
      arrange(desc(avg_air_temp_f)) %>%
      head(1)

    # Find the lowest temperature in 2012
    data %>%
      filter(year(date) == 2012) %>%
      arrange(avg_air_temp_f) %>%
      head(1)
    ```

    ```{r}
    data$date <- as.Date(data$date) # Convert date strings to date objects

    # plot the temperature and humidity of the year 2012, labeling the highest and lowest point
    data %>% 
      filter(year(date) == 2012) %>%  # Filter for the year 2012
      ggplot(aes(x = date)) + 
        geom_line(aes(y = avg_air_temp_f, color = "Temperature"), linewidth = 0.5) +

-   **Plot multiple plots**

    You can also plot multiple in one chart

    ```{r}
    data %>%
      filter(year(date) == 2012) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x=date, y=avg_air_temp_f, group=month(date), fill=month(date))) +
        geom_area() +
        ggtitle("Temperature by month in year 2012") +
        theme(
          legend.position="none",
        ) +
        facet_wrap(~month(date), scale="free_x") + 
        scale_fill_gradient(low = "green", high = "darkgreen")
    ```

<!-- -   **Using geospatial data** -->

<!--     gglot2 allows coordinated data. -->

<!--     ```{r} -->

<!--     # Create a heat map with coordinated data -->

<!--     census_data <- read.csv("data/us2021census.csv") -->

<!--     head(census_data) -->

<!--     ``` -->

<!--     ```{r} -->

<!--     # Create a clustered bar plot -->

<!--     census_data %>%  -->

<!--     filter(State=='WY') %>%  -->

<!--     ggplot(aes(x = City, y = Population)) + -->

<!--       geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + -->

<!--       labs(title = "City Population by State") + -->

<!--       theme_minimal() -->

<!--     ``` -->
