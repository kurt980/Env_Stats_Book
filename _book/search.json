R is very much a vehicle for newly developing methods of interactive data analysis. It has developed rapidly, and has been extended by a large collection of packages. However, most programs written in R are essentially ephemeral, written for a single piece of data analysis.",

(Indeed most of the system supplied functions are themselves written in the S language.)\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Environment Setup\nBefore you start, you want to do these 3 things first:\n\nInstall R R is a programming language\nInstall RStudio RStudio is the most widely-used IDE for R\nInstall tidyverse tidyverse is the collection of packages that are widely used for data analysis. The detailed introduction to tidyverse can be found in Section 1.2. You can use the below command in R to install tidyverse\n\n# &lt;&lt;cache=F, fig.width=6, fig.height=4&gt;&gt;=\n# install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(magrittr)\n\nThe pipe operator\nThe %&gt;% operator, also known as the “pipe operator”, is a powerful feature introduced by the magrittr package in R. It allows for a more readable and concise way of chaining together multiple function calls or operations. The pipe operator facilitates the creation of efficient and streamlined data analysis pipelines.\n\n# Using pipe operator to integrate commands\nexample &lt;- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), y = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10))\n\n# Calculate the mean of y for rows where x is greater than 2\nmean_y &lt;- example %&gt;% subset(x &gt; 2) %&gt;% pull(y) %&gt;% mean()\n\n# Print the mean\nprint(mean_y)\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Introduction to Packages\nIn R, “packages” are collections of functions, data, and documentation designed to extend the functionality of the base R system. These packages serve as valuable tools that provide specialized capabilities, making complex tasks easier to accomplish and expanding the scope of data analysis and statistical modeling. Each package is designed to address specific data analysis needs, making it easier for users to perform tasks from different disciplines.\nUsing packages in R is a seamless process. Once a package is installed, you can load it into your R session using the library() function. This makes all the functions and datasets within the package available for use. The packages and collections covered in this book are listed below. Most of them are integrated into the tidyverse collection.\n\nMASS The “MASS” package includes various functions for statistical modeling, linear and nonlinear regression, generalized linear models, time series analysis, clustering, and more. Additionally, it offers datasets used in the book’s examples and exercises, allowing users to replicate and experiment with the presented statistical methods.\nTidyverse The `tidyverse` package is a collection of R packages that provides a consistent and coherent framework for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization, promoting a tidy data format and streamlined data analysis workflows. The core packages within the `tidyverse`, including `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `lubridate`, `magrittr` and `purrr`, among others, offer powerful tools for data import, transformation, visualization, and modeling.\nmagrittr The magrittr package provides a set of operators, most notably the pipe operator %&gt;%, that enhances code readability and promotes a more fluent programming style in R. By chaining functions together, `magrittr` allows users to create a more structured and expressive data manipulation workflow.\nggplot2 `ggplot2` is a versatile and comprehensive data visualization package based on the Grammar of Graphics. With `ggplot2`, users can effortlessly create sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing visualizations that effectively communicate insights from their data.\ndplyr `dplyr` is a powerful package designed for data manipulation tasks in R. With a concise syntax and intuitive functions like `filter()`, `arrange()`, `mutate()`, and `summarise()`, `dplyr` simplifies and streamlines data wrangling, making it an essential tool for data analysts and data scientists.\nlubridate `lubridate` is a package specifically tailored for working with dates and times in R. Its user-friendly functions enable users to parse, manipulate, and format date-time data, making time-related analysis and data manipulation tasks more efficient and accurate.\nreadr `readr` is a fast and efficient package for reading and importing data into R. By providing easy-to-use functions to read various file formats, readr simplifies the data reading process and ensures accurate representation of data, enabling smoother data analysis workflows.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Variables\nYou can create variables like in all other programming languages using “-{” or “=”\n\nx &lt;- 21 \nprint(x)\n\n[1] 21\n\nx &lt;- \"text\" \nprint(x)\n\n[1] \"text\"\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Numbers and Vectors\nYou can also assign numeric values or vectors to your variables\n\nNumbers can be in many forms\n\n# Create numbers in r \nx &lt;- 3.5 # numeric \ny &lt;- 3L # integer \nz &lt;- 1i # complex\n\nVectors\n\n# Using the combine operator `c()` in r \nu &lt;- c(1,1,2,3,5) \n# Using the sequence operator `:` in r \nv &lt;- 1:5\n\nprint(u) \n\n[1] 1 1 2 3 5\n\nprint(v)\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n# length of vectors \nlength(u)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Strings and Boolean\nOther types of variables include strings and booleans\n\nString\n\n# String \ns &lt;- \"This is a string\" \nprint(s)\n\n[1] \"This is a string\"\n\n\nBoolean\n\n# Boolean \na &lt;- TRUE \nb &lt;- (1 &gt; 2)\n\nprint(a) \n\n[1] TRUE\n\nprint(b)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Working with Dates\nWorking with dates is supported by R. Date is a specific type of object implemented in R and supplemented by other packages such as lubridate\n\nDate formatting\n\n# Date formatting \ndate &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-07-10\") \nformatted_date &lt;- format(date, \"%A, %B %d, %Y\") \nprint(formatted_date)\n\n[1] \"Monday, July 10, 2023\"\n\n\nDate manipulation\n\nrequire(lubridate)\n\nLoading required package: lubridate\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'lubridate'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    date, intersect, setdiff, union\n\n# Adding days to a date \ndate &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-07-10\") \nnew_date &lt;- date + 7 \nprint(new_date)\n\n[1] \"2023-07-17\"\n\n# Subtracting months from a date \ndate &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-07-10\") \nnew_date &lt;- date - months(3) \nprint(new_date)\n\n[1] \"2023-04-10\"\n\n# Calculating the difference between two dates \ndate1 &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-07-10\") \ndate2 &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-06-10\") \ndiff &lt;- date1 - date2 \nprint(diff)\n\nTime difference of 30 days",

(Indeed most of the system supplied functions are themselves written in the S language.)\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Environment Setup\nBefore you start, you want to do these 3 things first:\n\nInstall R R is a programming language\nInstall RStudio RStudio is the most widely-used IDE for R\nInstall tidyverse tidyverse is the collection of packages that are widely used for data analysis. The detailed introduction to tidyverse can be found in Section 1.2. You can use the below command in R to install tidyverse\n\n# install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(magrittr)\n\nThe pipe operator\nThe %&gt;% operator, also known as the “pipe operator”, is a powerful feature introduced by the magrittr package in R. It allows for a more readable and concise way of chaining together multiple function calls or operations. The pipe operator facilitates the creation of efficient and streamlined data analysis pipelines.\n\n# Using pipe operator to integrate commands\nexample &lt;- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), y = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10))\n\n# Calculate the mean of y for rows where x is greater than 2\nmean_y &lt;- example %&gt;% subset(x &gt; 2) %&gt;% pull(y) %&gt;% mean()\n\n# Print the mean\nprint(mean_y)\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Introduction to Packages\nIn R, “packages” are collections of functions, data, and documentation designed to extend the functionality of the base R system. These packages serve as valuable tools that provide specialized capabilities, making complex tasks easier to accomplish and expanding the scope of data analysis and statistical modeling. Each package is designed to address specific data analysis needs, making it easier for users to perform tasks from different disciplines.\nUsing packages in R is a seamless process. Once a package is installed, you can load it into your R session using the library() function. This makes all the functions and data sets within the package available for use. The packages and collections covered in this book are listed below. Most of them are integrated into the tidyverse collection.\n\nMASS The “MASS” package includes various functions for statistical modeling, linear and nonlinear regression, generalized linear models, time series analysis, clustering, and more. Additionally, it offers data sets used in the book’s examples and exercises, allowing users to replicate and experiment with the presented statistical methods.\nTidyverse The tidyverse package is a collection of R packages that provides a consistent and coherent framework for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization, promoting a tidy data format and streamlined data analysis workflows. The core packages within the tidyverse, including dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr, lubridate, magrittr and purrr, among others, offer powerful tools for data import, transformation, visualization, and modeling.\nmagrittr The magrittr package provides a set of operators, most notably the pipe operator %&gt;%, that enhances code readability and promotes a more fluent programming style in R. By chaining functions together, magrittr allows users to create a more structured and expressive data manipulation workflow.\nggplot2 ggplot2 is a versatile and comprehensive data visualization package based on the Grammar of Graphics. With ggplot2, users can effortlessly create sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing visualizations that effectively communicate insights from their data.\ndplyr dplyr is a powerful package designed for data manipulation tasks in R. With a concise syntax and intuitive functions like filter(), arrange(), mutate(), and summarise(), dplyr simplifies and streamlines data wrangling, making it an essential tool for data analysts and data scientists.\nlubridate lubridate is a package specifically tailored for working with dates and times in R. Its user-friendly functions enable users to parse, manipulate, and format date-time data, making time-related analysis and data manipulation tasks more efficient and accurate.\nreadr readr is a fast and efficient package for reading and importing data into R. By providing easy-to-use functions to read various file formats, readr simplifies the data reading process and ensures accurate representation of data, enabling smoother data analysis workflows.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Variables\nYou can create variables like in all other programming languages using “-{” or “=”\n\nx &lt;- 21 \nprint(x)\n\n[1] 21\n\nx &lt;- \"text\" \nprint(x)\n\n[1] \"text\"\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Numbers and Vectors\nYou can also assign numeric values or vectors to your variables\n\nNumbers can be in many forms\n\n# Create numbers in r \nx &lt;- 3.5 # numeric \ny &lt;- 3L # integer \nz &lt;- 1i # complex\n\nVectors\n\n# Using the combine operator `c()` in r \nu &lt;- c(1,1,2,3,5) \n# Using the sequence operator `:` in r \nv &lt;- 1:5\n\nprint(u) \n\n[1] 1 1 2 3 5\n\nprint(v)\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n# length of vectors \nlength(u)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Strings and Boolean\nOther types of variables include strings and booleans\n\nString\n\n# String \ns &lt;- \"This is a string\" \nprint(s)\n\n[1] \"This is a string\"\n\n\nBoolean\n\n# Boolean \na &lt;- TRUE \nb &lt;- (1 &gt; 2)\n\nprint(a) \n\n[1] TRUE\n\nprint(b)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Working with Dates\nWorking with dates is supported by R. Date is a specific type of object implemented in R and supplemented by other packages such as lubridate\n\nDate formatting\n\n\n# Date formatting \ndate &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-07-10\") \nformatted_date &lt;- format(date, \"%A, %B %d, %Y\") \nprint(formatted_date)\n\n[1] \"Monday, July 10, 2023\"\n\n# test\n\n\nDate manipulation\n\n\nrequire(lubridate)\n\nLoading required package: lubridate\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'lubridate'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    date, intersect, setdiff, union\n\n# Adding days to a date \ndate &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-07-10\") \nnew_date &lt;- date + 7 \nprint(new_date)\n\n[1] \"2023-07-17\"\n\n# Subtracting months from a date \ndate &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-07-10\") \nnew_date &lt;- date - months(3) \nprint(new_date)\n\n[1] \"2023-04-10\"\n\n# Calculating the difference between two dates \ndate1 &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-07-10\") \ndate2 &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-06-10\") \ndiff &lt;- date1 - date2 \nprint(diff)\n\nTime difference of 30 days",
